I worked on this project alone.

I had challenges with getting the seed to work correctly on the map and word models. Certain times, I would end up with a start index of a massize amount that would make my program go out of bounds. I addressed this by generating a random index and using the modulus operator to ensure it was less than the maximum size of the list.

I thought this assignment was very interesting. It was fun to look at the concept of the frequency of patterns in the text and use it to generate random text.
I disliked how difficult it was to ensure my program was actually generating random text and not just copying blocks of the specified size.

I spent about 5 hours working on this problem. Probably 2 getting the initial work done implementing the algorithms from the write up, then the rest of it debugging and fixing problems with the code.
