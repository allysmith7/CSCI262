The main challenge that I encountered during this project was understanding the concept of 'word families' and create a way to implement that.
I decided on using a map with the key being a string to represent the word family and then a set of strings to hold the words that fit in this family.
This allowed me to quickly get the set of remaining words once I determined the largest family.

I loved this assignment. The idea behind it was entertaining and implementing it was challenging enough that it took some time just brainstorming to come up with an adequate solution.

I spent probably 5 or 6 hours programming this over the course of 2 days. I did a big chunk of about 4 getting the basics down, then 2 hours debugging the reset feature and cleaning/documenting code.

I didn't add any particularly interesting features.
